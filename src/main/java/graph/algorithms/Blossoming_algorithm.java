/*
- add one and one edge
- build an augmented path
- for every added edge
  1. finds no augmented path, has found max matching - add new edge
  2. can find new augmented path, make better matching - find the new matching
  3. can find a blossom - make the blossom to one node


 Augmented path:
 a path with no cycles
